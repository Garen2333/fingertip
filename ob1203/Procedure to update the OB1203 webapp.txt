1. Connect debugger to Renesas board (use one that doesn't have the reset pin connected)
2. open Smart Snippets Toolbox v5.0.10 etc --the old version
3. Choose DA14531 using the JTAG interface
4. Choose the file ob1203_v150_multi_img.bin
5. deselect bootable
6. set offset to 0x20000 and memory range to 0x40000
7. connect
8. erase
9. burn and verify
10.power cycle chip
The file is here: C:\Users\a5114632\git\BP\renesas-bio.github.io\ob1203 in the local repo as well, or on the remote github repo at renesas-bio.

The login name is renesas-bio and the password is RenesasNumber1.

1. Login to Github as renesas-bio using the password RenesasNumber1
2. Generate the new binary by compiling the Keil project. My project is currently located on my local repository at C:\DiaSemi\DA145xx_SDK\6.0.14.1114\projects\target_apps\ble_examples\ble_app_plx\Keil_5\out_DA14531\Objects.
There is also a remote repo on Renesas Gitlab.

3. Increment the version number in the file user_config/user_profiles_config.h, line 99.
4. Also update device name in user_config.h #define USER_DEVICE_NAME        "DLG-OB1203-v1.6"
5. Once you have a new binary, you need to convert the binary in the objects file to a javascript file that puts the binary in a JSON format using the python script fileimport.py.
6. Open fileimport.py using notepad or notepad++ etc. Increment the version number on line 31 to match the number you chose in step 3. Save the python script
7. Delete the file latest_firmware.js. You will be creating a new one.
8. Run the python script. Type ble_app_plx_531. Press enter. You now have a new latest_firmware.js file.
9. Copy the output file latest_firmware.js to the directory with the web code, for instance C:\Users\a5114632\git\BP\renesas-bio.github.io or to the repo or clone of the repo at https://github.com/renesas-bio/renesas-bio.github.io. Update the repo.
10. Navigate to renesas-bio.github.io/ob1203/ob1203.html and refresh the browser every couple of minutes until it updates.
